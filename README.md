Congratulations, you got a contract to build software for a book store. The book store owner wants to have a software that will keep record of all books in the book store. 

Letâ€™s start by building couple of objects: a book and a store. Book will contain information about each book (research which fields are needed). The store will contain all the book and should be able to add a book to the store, remove a book, search for a book.
