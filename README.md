Congratulations, you got a contract to build software for a book store. The book store owner wants to have a software that will keep record of all books in the book store. 

Letâ€™s start by building couple of objects: a book and a store. Book will contain information about each book (research which fields are needed). The store will contain all the book and should be able to add a book to the store, remove a book, search for a book. 

Next:
We want to be able to list books by price, for example: if someone wants to buy the cheapest book, we should be able to list all book in descending order based on price. In addition we would like to sort by ascending price.

In addition sometimes customers like to see books sorted by author name, let's implement ascending and descending order by author name.
